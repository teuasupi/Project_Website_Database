# Frontend Implementation Plan: IKA TEUAS UPI Website

**Date:** July 19, 2025
**Author:** Ramdan
**Project:** IKA TEUAS UPI Alumni Website Frontend

## Overview

Based on the PRD analysis, I'll implement a comprehensive alumni website with 12 core features using Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

- **Set up additional dependencies** (React Hook Form, Axios, NextAuth, Framer Motion, etc.)
- **Create project structure** with organized directories for components, pages, types, and utilities
- **Configure TypeScript types** for API integration and shared interfaces
- **Set up API client** for backend communication
- **Configure authentication** with NextAuth.js

## Phase 2: Core Pages & Layout (FEAT-01, FEAT-02, FEAT-05)

- **Global Layout Component** with responsive navigation, header, and footer
- **Homepage** (FEAT-01) with hero section, announcements, and highlights
- **About TEUAS** (FEAT-02) static page with background, vision, mission
- **Contact & Services** (FEAT-05) with contact info and alumni services

## Phase 3: Content Management (FEAT-03, FEAT-04)

- **News and Events** (FEAT-03) with listing, detail pages, and admin management
- **Media Gallery** (FEAT-04) with photo/video display and filtering
- **Content management components** for admin interface

## Phase 4: Alumni Features (FEAT-06, FEAT-07, FEAT-08)

- **Alumni Registration** (FEAT-07) with secure signup flow
- **Alumni Profiles & Database** (FEAT-06) with searchable directory and profile management
- **Alumni Blog & Articles** (FEAT-08) with publishing and reading capabilities

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (FEAT-09, FEAT-10)

- **Discussion Forum** (FEAT-09) with external platform integration
- **Scholarship & Endowment Portal** (FEAT-10) with donation information and contact forms

## Phase 6: Technical Requirements (TECH-01, TECH-02, TECH-03)

- **Responsive Design** (TECH-01) ensuring mobile/tablet compatibility
- **Admin Dashboard** (TECH-02) for content and user management
- **Security Implementation** (TECH-03) with proper authentication and validation

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT integration to existing backend
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom hooks for global state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom theme matching TEUAS branding
- **API Integration**: Axios client with TypeScript types
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
